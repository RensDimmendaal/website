Have you ever felt excited to share something? A blogpost, a sales pitch, or presentation? And have you felt sad or frustrated when you didn't get the positive response you were looking for? 

**Did you think to yourself: but I really have a great solution!?**

Then I know your pain. And there is one trap I keep falling into and see others fall in all the time as well. I see it most often when techies try to pitch a technical solution. Here's the mistake: 

**Your audience's problem is NOT the absence of your solution**

## Some examples:

If you want to share a neat documentation framework. The lack of structure isn't your readers problem. But potential users getting frustrated and giving up on your product is. 

If you want to explain a neat mathematical concept, e..g, a graph. Missing knowledge isn't your readers problem. But curiousity about how to connect users in a social network with new friend recommendations is.

If you want to pitch a new ride hailing service. Not having a taxi at your door within 10min isn't your audience's problem. Getting soaked and catching a cold in the storming rains while trying to hail a ride is.

## Here's my tip on how to avoid it:

Whenever you're excited about something and want to share it with the world. Take a step back and identify the **feelings** and **unmet needs** of your audience and **disconnect them from your solution**. Dig deep. And then...

## Connect with your audience on those unmet feelings and needs BEFORE you share your solution.

It works for me...whenever I actually remember to apply it.

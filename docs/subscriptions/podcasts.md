# Podcasts

I like listening to podcasts. Below are the ones I have subscribed to. I don't listen to all of them. Most podcasts are interview based and I listen to them based on the guest.

* [Adversarial Learning](https://adversariallearning.com/) -- Rarely releases, but good content. Co-hosted by Joel Grus who you may know from his talk about how he does not like notebooks, and the book Data Science From Scratch. He and the other co-host interview people in a casual setting.

The podcast is co-hosted by one data science manager and one web developer, where the former explains topics to the latter. It has a nice mix basic concepts, recent paper discussions, and data science’s impact on society. Episodes start with a pun.

They've stopped releasing for a while now, but you can still download their stuff. You might know one of the people Chisalbon(.com) who has a nice cheatsheet website and a cool set of flashcards.

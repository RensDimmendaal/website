# Karabiner -- Hotkeys

Credits for these tips go to [Nikita Voloboev](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6):

* Remap pressing caps lock to escape; especially helpful if you like vim mode in editors.
* Remap holding caps lock to ctrl+option with [karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/); so you can create your own shortcuts. I read about it [here](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and haven't looked back. I use caps+S for snippets lab and caps+B for autoformat in vscode, and caps+I for opening iterm in the current finder directory.

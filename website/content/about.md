## Builder of AI products and teams

I help companies do this: `data -> insight -> action -> value`.

I train their people, streamline their processes, and code things up too.

## Worker on side projects

Occasionally I [write](/posts/). I work on [side projects](/projects/) too.

## Minor contributions to open source

I'm not a big contributor to open source, but I am a fan of the boy scout rule:

> Leave the ~~campground~~ codebase cleaner than you found it

For me that means reporting and fixing mistakes that I find in the software that I use.

I'm proud of my minor contributions to both niche and popular packages like huggingface transformers, mlflow, and tensorflow.

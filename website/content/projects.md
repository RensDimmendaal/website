## Better Images of AI

I believe "Better Images of AI" is a great initiative.

Their goal is to replace unhelpful cliche images of AI, think stuff like 🤖🧠🔮, with ones that are more representative of what AI can and cannot do today.

That's why I contributed some of my work to their project.

Below you can find two of the images I created. For more check it out their [website](https://betterimagesofai.org/)!

## NeurIPS Talk & Data Centric AI Competition (2021)

In 2021 I participated, and won, in Andrew Ng's first Data Centric AI competition.
As a result we got to do a short presentation at NeurIPS conference. Sadly that talk is not publicly available, but you can find our blogposts here:

## Emoji Recommender (2020)

> I like to add emoji to text 😁  
But sometimes I dont know which one to add 🤷  
There are too many, it's overwhelming  😖  
My laptop's emoji finder is too literal 🙅  
I want meaningful suggestions 💌

## Rhyme with AI (2019)

A collaboration with my colleague Henk Griffioen.

This was a silly side project when the huggingface implementation of BERT was just released.

In the Netherlands we have a tradition of writing poems when we give our sinterklaas presents (our santa claus).
They usually follow a basic `AABB` pattern, so we wanted to make an app that finds a nice second sentence that rhymes with your first sentence.
